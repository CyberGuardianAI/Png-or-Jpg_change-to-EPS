# Png-or-Jpg_change-to-EPS
When submitting the final manuscript to IEEE, it is common to encounter image format requirements specifying EPS format. However, directly converting images from formats such as PNG or JPG to EPS may result in excessively large file sizes or compatibility issues. To address this challenge, I developed a Python program that efficiently converts PNG and JPG images to EPS while also performing compression and optimization. The program reduces the size of the resulting EPS files by adjusting the image resolution (DPI) and dimensions (with maximum width and height limits), ensuring that the output image quality meets IEEE requirements. This tool is user-friendly and automatically processes images in batch from a specified folder, saving the converted EPS files in a designated directory, thereby significantly improving the efficiency and controllability of image format conversion.
